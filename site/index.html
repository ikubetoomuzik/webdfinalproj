                <p>This site will be serving as a central hub of information regarding my home computer/networking setup.</p>
                <p>It has come to the point now where I have so much on the go that constantly relearning concepts to understand what I've done is not working.</p>

                    <h3>Email Server</h3>
                    <p>Goal setup is a DigitalOcean droplet running a dovecot/postfix solution to host a small number of addresses for personal use.</p>
                    <p>Using a set of articles from arstechnica(maybe add link here) I did already attempt once but was unsuccessful and had to wipe the droplet.</p>
                    <p>Have managed to dig up some more resources to use and just need to parse them and come to a better understanding of the programs.</p>

                    <h3>Laptop Reformat</h3>
                    <p>Goal setup is a functioning Arch Linux & Windows 10 dual boot on the 256GB NVMe SSD I have.</p>
                    <p>Currently have a Windows 10 & Manjaro Linux dual boot and it was configured poorly enough that Windows is actually the more stable and less resource hungry OS.</p>
                    <p>This project does depend on the correct documentation for my current desktop Arch build as that is the only Arch build I am comfortable admining.</p>

            <h3>Desktop PC</h3>
                    <p>Currently has 3 drives installed: </p>
                    <p>One has Windows 10 home installed with 512GB of space on the drive.</p>
                    <p>Another is 256GB with a custom Arch Linux install (that should be the main focus of these docs).</p>
                    <p>One final drive formatted as NTFS and being used for torrent/steam game storage.</p>

            <h3>Pi Server</h3>
                    <p>OpenVPN Server used for remote connections back into the home network.</p>
                    <p>Includes instructions on where to find CA and how to generate/validate/revoke requests.</p>
                </article>

            <h3>Home/Minecraft Server</h3>
                    <p>Set up the server with a small basic Arch linux install so that minimal resources are being used to actually run the server.</p>
                    <p>A couple weeks into running the server near constantly the boot drive stopped being detected -- yet to have time to determine cause.</p>
                    <p>Looks like on boot the pc is trying to boot over the network at a specific mac address -- may just be BIOS issue.</p>
