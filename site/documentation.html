                    <p>Right now I have three seperate drives in my home pc:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>512GB SATA Kingston SSD - Windows 10 Home</li>
                        <li>256GB SATA Kingston SSD - Arch Linux</li>
                        <li>1TB 7200RPM Seagate HDD - Used for Steam and Media Storage</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Arch Linux Install</h3>
                    <p>My goal was basically to start with the most minimal install and build it up from there.</p>
                    <p>I'm pretty sure the only install groups I used were base and base-devel.</p>
                    <p>My system uses xOrg as the display server with LightDM and AwesomeWM as the login and window managers.</p>

                    <h3>The Basics</h3>
                    <p>The Pi presents a different challenge as it is powered by an ARM processor. This is a more efficient if much less powerful architechture than the normal desktop x86 architechture.</p>
                    <p>Due to the large community around the Pi there are many OSs designed specifically to take advantage of the ARM architecture and run well. But being me I instead chose to find the Ubuntu Server ARM build so I could get some experience with that...</p>
                    <p>The install process was odd but relatively painless. There is a live ARM Ubuntu Server image that is updated and released semi-regularly. The install consists of just copying the iso file onto a sd card then inserting it into the Pi.</p>

                    <h3>OpenVPN Server</h3>
                    <p>The main service running here is OpenVPN. I use this mostly to connect back home and work or get files. But a nice secondary use is to give family access to admin the Minecraft server when I'm not home.</p>

                    <h3>So why?</h3>
                    <p>Found a good local deal for an old refurbished Optiplex PC with a simple core duo and DDR3 RAM. The good news is that I have an old video card and additional RAM so I could possibly make it into a crappy gaming PC for a guest or LAN party.</p>
                    <p>Also needed to find a more power efficient option for the minecraft server that my cousin and I use. And since its gonna be on 24/7 for possible minecraft - I have no issue setting up a small ftp server and network drive to get the media files out of the desktop.</p>

                    <h3>What is the OS then?</h3>
                    <p>When I first got the machine it came with a free Windows Home license but I pretty much immediately wiped it and installed Arch Linux.</p>
                    <p>But just the other day the server refused to boot stating 'Boot device not detected.' When watching the system try to boot I think it's trying to use the network all of a sudden -- weird.</p>
